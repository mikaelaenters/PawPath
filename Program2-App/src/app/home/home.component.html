<div class="blockSytles center"><h2>Welcome to Paw Path</h2>
    Paw Path is a grassroots organization built from the ground up by dog people for dog people. Originally a neighborhood group of kids doing a summer job, Paw Path grew by word-of-mouth and old-fashioned paper fliers into a dog walking agency. As time and technology went on, however, we could no longer rely on word-of-mouth alone to keep our business alive. So, we now invite you to connect with us from our new website.
    We understand that dogs are part of the family too. We work with Walkers™ and pet parents to help ensure that your dogs get the exercise
    they need, whenever they need it.
    Paw Path offers convenient dog walking services through our website, pet insurance while your fur-babies are in our
    care, and accidental injusry insurance for our Walkers™.
    Paw Path is a community you can trust. Reviews connect pet parents' experiences and Walkers'™ hard work.</div>
